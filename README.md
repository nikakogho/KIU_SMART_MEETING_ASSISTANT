# Smart Meeting Assistant

## üìú Project Description

This project, "Smart Meeting Assistant," is the final assignment for Building AI Powered Apps.

KIU Consulting is currently losing an estimated 25,000 GEL per employee each year due to inefficient meetings. This AI-powered system aims to solve this problem by automatically processing meeting recordings to extract valuable, actionable insights and build a searchable knowledge base for the entire organization.

The core of this project is a web application that leverages a suite of OpenAI APIs to offer a seamless solution for meeting analysis and knowledge management.

## ‚ú® Core Features

This application integrates four key OpenAI APIs to deliver its primary functionalities:

### üîä 1. Audio Processing with Whisper API

* **Transcription**: Transcribes audio recordings of meetings from formats like `.mp3`, `.wav`, and `.m4a`.
* **Speaker Identification**: Capable of handling audio files ranging from 20 to 30 minutes and distinguishing between different speakers in the conversation.

### üß† 2. Content Analysis with GPT-4 and Function Calling

* **Meeting Summaries**: Generates concise summaries that highlight the key discussion points and outcomes.
* **Action Item Extraction**: Identifies and extracts actionable tasks, and assigns ownership of those tasks to the responsible individuals.
* **Calendar and Task Integration (Bonus)**: Connects with calendar and task management APIs to automatically create events and to-do items from the meeting's content.

### üîç 3. Semantic Search with Embeddings API

* **Knowledge Base Creation**: Develops a searchable repository of information from all processed meetings.
* **Similarity-Based Recommendations**: Suggests relevant past meetings or documents based on the content of the current meeting.

### üé® 4. Visual Concept Synthesis with DALL-E 3

* **Visual Summaries**: Creates engaging visual representations of meeting outcomes for stakeholders who were not in attendance.
* **Automated Presentation Assets**: Generates images and diagrams that can be used in follow-up presentations and reports.

## üöÄ Advanced Features

* **Real-Time Processing**: Live meeting transcription and analysis using WebSocket technology.
* **Predictive Analytics**: Predicts the effectiveness of a meeting based on various data points.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

The successful implementation of this project relies on the seamless integration of the following OpenAI APIs:

* **Whisper API** for audio transcription.
* **GPT-4** with **Function Calling** for content analysis and task extraction.
* **Embeddings API** for creating a semantic search engine.
* **DALL-E 3** for generating visual summaries.
